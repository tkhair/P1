    <h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
    <p>I'm 26 years old HES student pursuing my ALM IT degree. For the last 5 years I live in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (a bit far away from Cambridge!) and building my career in project management. Currently I work for Cloud solutions provider trying to make cloud infrastructure available for various businesses. </p>
    
    <h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
    <p>I'd like to expand my knowledge of dynamic web development mainly for personal needs: I frequently have some sort of web-services ideas and want to be able to prototype or even get them done by myself. I was involved in plenty of web development project at the beggining of my career, but now web-interfaces are usually just part of larger projects, and I'd like to keep my awareness of web dev side always high.</p>
    
    <h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
    <p>Apart of theoretical background about algorithmisation, DB systems and programming tehcniques I've worked with some LAMP-based open source CMSs (Drupal, Joomla, Wordpress), mainly collecting ready-made components in one custom engine. <br/>
    I was also kinda PRO in VBA during undergrad days :)</p>
    
    <h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
    <p>I work on a PC.</p>
    
    <h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
    <p>I'll be using my GoDaddy web-hosting account to host term projects.</p>
